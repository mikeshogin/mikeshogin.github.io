description: System Analyst & IT Architect - Building better systems through strategic analysis
slug: /
---


**I bring clarity to complex systems.**  
Through system analysis, architecture, and AI-driven documentation.

---

I help teams think clearer, deliver faster, and feel confident about where they're going.

I work at the intersection of product, architecture, and engineering —  
supporting decisions with documentation, diagrams, and reasoning, not guesswork.
