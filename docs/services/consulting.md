# ðŸ§© IT Consulting & Strategic Roadmapping

## What is it?

IT consulting is help from an experienced architect who knows how to ask the right questions, see the whole system, and offer balanced solutions.
<br />
I work as an external partner, helping you organize your architecture, find a development direction, and build a technology strategy based on real business goals.

---

## When do you need it?

- You feel "chaos" but don't know where to start structuring
- The company is launching a **new product** or scaling an existing one
- You need to **connect business strategy and technical architecture**
- It's important to **rebuild processes and architecture for new goals**
- The architecture has grown and it's unclear how to develop it further

---

## What I do

- Conduct an **audit of the current state**: architecture, processes, teams, practices
- Help **formulate strategic goals and constraints**
- Build an **architectural model** with levels: business â†’ components â†’ teams
- Identify **problem areas, duplication, bottlenecks**
- Develop an **architecture map** and **development roadmap**
- Discuss: priorities, risks, resources, stages

---

## What you get

- Visual and textual **architecture strategy**
- Clear understanding: **what needs to be done and in what order**
- Roadmap document: stages, priorities, possible risks
- Ability to discuss architecture development in a common language â€” for CTO, team, business
- Support in communication between teams and levels of responsibility

---

## Work format

- From 2 to 6 weeks
- Several sessions: interviews, facilitation, analysis, presentations
- Final result â€” **document, diagrams, discussion, and support**

---

## For whom

- For **leaders** looking for a technology partner to help formulate strategy
- For **architects** who need an "outside perspective" and a partner for discussion
- For **teams** that are confused by structure but want to move forward consciously

---

## Result

âœ… You will have:
- Architecture strategy tied to business goals
- Development roadmap: clear, realistic, agreed upon
- Clear understanding: **where you are, where you're going, and how to get there**
