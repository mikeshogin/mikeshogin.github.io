# üîç System Analysis

## What is it?

System analysis is a way to turn scattered ideas, wishes, and requirements into a clear structure of actions.  
I help teams understand **what exactly needs to be done**, **why**, and **in what order**.

---

## When do you need it?

- You have a product idea but don't know how to implement it technically
- A project is launching or restarting and needs a clear task description
- There is documentation, but it's chaotic ‚Äî no one understands what to do
- The team receives "abstract wishes" and wastes time guessing
- You need to connect business goals and technical implementation

---

## What I do

- Immerse myself in the business context and goals
- Conduct interviews with stakeholders, product managers, and users
- Formulate tasks as structured requirements
- Decompose into levels: from goals ‚Üí features ‚Üí epics ‚Üí tasks
- Describe system interactions, cases, and constraints
- Help prepare architectural descriptions for tasks
- Use AI tools, based on my models, to speed up analysis and draft generation

---

## What you get

- Clear requirements in a convenient format (Markdown, Confluence, YouTrack, ...)
- Task structure ‚Äî understandable to both implementers and management
- Interaction diagrams, entity tables, use cases
- Fewer "redos" due to misunderstandings
- A base for task setting, architecture, and testing

---

## Work format

- from 1 week ‚Äî for compact MVPs or modules
- Joint workshops, interviews, documentation
- Use AI tools, based on my models, and templates for speed
- At the end ‚Äî a requirements map and task structure

---

## For whom

- For product managers and analysts who need to:
  - **formulate a task so the team understands**
  - **start a project right ‚Äî with clear decomposition**
- For teams where:
  - **requirements constantly change and no one keeps up**
  - **developers spend time clarifying "what to do"**
- For architects who need to understand business domains

---

## Result

‚úÖ You will have:
- Understanding of **what needs to be done** and **why**
- Clear structure of tasks and requirements
- A single document that's easy to work with
<br />
You'll stop guessing and start doing things right the first time.
