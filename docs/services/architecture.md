# ðŸ§­ Architecture Audit & Landscape

## What is it?

Architecture audit is a way to see your system "from the outside." I help teams and companies realize their current state:
- where the bottlenecks are,
- which components are duplicated,
- what hinders development,
- where the architecture needs attention.

---

## When do you need it?

- The team is struggling to develop the product
- There is architectural debt, but it's unclear where to start addressing it
- The system grew chaotically, and no one sees the big picture
- Scaling is planned, but it's unclear if the architecture can handle it
- Management needs a simple and clear view of the architecture

---

## What I do

- Interview key participants: developers, architects, product owners
- Analyze current infrastructure, codebase, and practices
- Build a C4 model: from components to contexts and aspects
- Identify architectural debt and risks
- Find duplication zones, outdated links, and implicit dependencies
- Prepare an architecture map and recommendations for development

---

## What you get

- Architecture landscape in a **tool convenient for the client**
  - Confluence, YouTrack, DocHub, Wiki, markdown repository
- List of problem areas and debt
- Recommendations for architecture improvement
- Ability to discuss architecture with the team and management in a common language
- Foundation for architectural decision-making

---

## Work format

- from 2 weeks â€” for small and medium products
- Online/offline meetings, documentation, visualization
- At the end â€” report and joint session to discuss results

---

## For whom

- For teams that have
  - **many microservices and it's unclear how they're connected**
  - **a monolithic system**
- For architects who **inherited a complex system and want to understand it**
- For managers who need to **see the weak points** and how to address them
- For companies preparing for growth or scaling

---

## Result

âœ… You will have:
- A clear architectural model (diagrams, descriptions, hyperlinks)
- A report with findings and priorities
- An action plan

You will finally understand: **where you are, what is holding you back, and what to do about it**.
