# ðŸŽ“ Mentorship & Coaching

## What is it?

I support the growth of IT professionals: **from first steps to independent architectural decision-making**.
<br />
Mentoring is not just about answering questions. It's about development, thinking, and moving toward your goal. We work together to:
<br />
- understand where you are now and where you want to go;
- create a plan;
- move along it â€” with support, feedback, and challenges that help you grow.

## Who is it for?

- **Junior developers and analysts**: building a technical foundation, work habits, engineering mindset
- **Mid-level developers and analysts**: systems thinking, architectural mindset, career growth
- **Senior+**: coaching for moving to influence roles â€” tech lead, architect, expert
