# ðŸ“š Documentation & Decision Frameworks

## What is it?

When architecture and processes are clearly documented, the team starts thinking in a unified model. This service is about structure, repeatability, and preserving collective memory.
<br />
I help you organize documentation:
- formalize decisions,
- record architecture,
- build a knowledge system,
so everyone knows **why something was done this way** and **how it works**.

---

## When do you need it?

- The team is growing, and "it's all in my head" no longer works
- Key employees leave, and knowledge leaves with them
- Architectural decisions are lost or repeated
- It's hard to explain the system to new people
- The company has several products, and each does things differently
- Documentation is either outdated or never read

---

## What I do

- Help **organize architecture and decisions**: we record why things are done a certain way
- Structure **all important information** about the product and system â€” from business goals to technical constraints
- Create **living and understandable documentation** that people actually read
- Build a **knowledge system**: where to look, how to find, who is responsible
- Help develop a **unified style of thinking and communication**
- Teach the team: **how to document and make decisions** so you don't have to redo everything

<details>
<summary>What's inside (for techies)</summary>

- I use practices like:
  - **ADR** â€” Architecture Decision Records
  - **TDR** â€” Team Decision Records
  - **C4 model** â€” Contexts, containers, components, code
- I document in tools familiar to the team:
  - PlantUML, Markdown, Confluence, Notion, DocHub
- Help develop a **unified style of thinking and documentation**
