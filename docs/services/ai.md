# ðŸ¤– AI Workflow Integration

## What is it?

AI integration is not just about "plugging in GPT".  
It's about:  
- building **working scenarios**,  
- creating **reliable agents**,  
- embedding AI into daily processes so that **it truly helps**.  
<br />
I help you do this **without cloud risks** and with respect for privacy:  
- I use **local LLMs** (Mistral, DeepSeek, LLaMA, Phi, Codellama),
- I work on your infrastructure or help you set it up.

---

## When do you need it?

- You want to automate routine and eliminate repetitive actions
- You need to speed up analytics, documentation, planning, or support
- You need to integrate AI into existing business processes
- It's important to keep **control over data** and **not send it to the cloud**
- You want to build your own AI agents tailored to your domain

---

## What I do

- Analyze current processes and identify where AI can help
- Design AI pipelines: from task â†’ through agent â†’ to result
- Write agents in **Python / Bash / Go**, set up web interfaces and console scripts
- Integrate with familiar tools: **Telegram, Notion, Excel, Google Docs**
- Set up **local LLMs** (Mistral, DeepSeek, LLama, etc.) on your machine or local network
- Develop clear **chat interfaces or forms** so employees can simply "ask" and get results
- Apply **Prompt Engineering** and create templates for your business
- Set up RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines
- Help adapt the model to your context and input

---

## What you get

- **Ready-to-use AI agents** with a simple interface:
  - Web interface, Telegram bot, local form, or chat window
- Automated scenarios: planning, data analysis, documentation generation
- Integration with your documents and data (Excel, text files, Google Docs)
- Private AI infrastructure that works **on your computer or server**
- Documentation and instructions: how to use, adapt, and scale
- Consulting and support for system expansion

## Work format

- from 2 weeks â€” for basic integration and agent setup
- Joint sessions: define scenarios, build the pipeline
- Further: train your team, scale, support

---

## For whom

- For companies that **want AI but are not ready to share data with OpenAI**
- For teams that **are tired of routine and want to automate**
- For architects and analysts who need a **smart assistant**
- For startups that want to embed AI in the product from the start

---

## Result

âœ… You will have:
- A working system with AI agents embedded in real processes
- Full control over code, data, and logic
- Private AI without cloud dependency
- Understanding of **how it works** and **how to develop it further**
<br />
This is not magic. This is engineering.  
And I'll help you make it your own.
