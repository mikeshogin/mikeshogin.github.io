## Who am I?

I'm **Mike Shogin**, a system analyst and architect with **over 15 years of professional experience** and a strong background in applied mathematics. My career spans multiple industries—including massive email platforms, AdTech, HRTech, and Fintech—where I've consistently led complex architecture transformations and introduced sustainable solutions.
<br />
Currently, I specialize in integrating advanced AI workflows, local Large Language Models (LLMs), and structured system analysis to help mature teams and organizations navigate complexity clearly and confidently.

## What I Do

- **Clarity from Complexity:** I untangle challenging systems and make them understandable and navigable.
- **Strategic Architectural Guidance:** I build clear, maintainable architectures and documentation that survive handovers and vacations.
- **AI-Driven Analysis:** I use advanced AI tools and custom-developed solutions to amplify analytical thinking, streamline documentation, and enhance decision-making.
- **Sustainable Systems:** My focus is always on creating systems and documentation that remain valuable and actionable over time.

## My Approach

- **Deep Research First:** I begin by deeply understanding the existing systems and team challenges.
- **Structured Thinking:** I create architectures and documentation with clear logic and intuitive structure.
- **Actionable Documentation:** Documentation isn't paperwork—it's a tool that teams actively use.
- **AI as a Partner:** I leverage AI to enhance clarity, efficiency, and sustainability, not to replace human thinking.
